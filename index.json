Interestingly, the presence of conflicting positive and negative reactions (objective ambivalence) is weakly related to feeling conflicted (subjective ambivalence). We tested a novel situation that can influence the correspondence between objective and subjective ambivalence:whether a message and a recipient’s topic match in affective versus cognitive orientation. When a person encounters a message with an affective or cognitive match to the topic, conflicting reactions may be more accessible, increasing feelings of ambivalence. Across five studies, greater objective–subjective ambivalence correspondence occurred with an affective–cognitive match between message and topic orientation. Studies 4 and 5 also demonstrated that this primarily occurred when the message was counterattitudinal. This work contributes to the literature explaining the gap between measures of objective and subjective ambivalence as well as how messages can influence attitude strength properties.","tags":[],"title":"When objective ambivalence leads to subjective ambivalence:An affect-cognition matching perspective","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wei Jie Reiner Ng","Chi Bu","Ya Hui Michelle See"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1646092800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646092800,"objectID":"24f7a07b0388793264d15dc8b3822513","permalink":"https://reinerng.github.io/publication/defensive-confidence/","publishdate":"2022-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/defensive-confidence/","section":"publication","summary":"Despite much prior research on matching appeals to the affective-cognitive orientation of attitudes, little attention has focused on the consequences of affect-cognition (mis)matching when individuals resist persuasion. We propose that unlike amatched attack, an attack that is mismatched to the affective-cognitive orientation of attitudes would result in low defensive confidence individuals holding onto their unchanged attitudes with less certainty than high defensive confidence individuals. As hypothesized, low defensive confidence participants were less certain after an affective than a cognitive attack for a cognitive issue (Study 1), and the opposite was true for an affective issue (Study 2). Both patterns occurred again when the affective-cognitive orientation of attitudes was manipulated (Study 3) or measured as an individual difference (Study 4). Moreover, perceived knowledge mediated the effects on attitude certainty (Study 4). We end by discussing implications for our understanding of affect- cognition matching and attitude certainty.","tags":[],"title":"Defensive confidence and certainty in unchanged attitudes:The role of affect-cognition matching.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wei Jie Reiner Ng","Ya Hui Michelle See"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1580515200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580515200,"objectID":"3ec09b5903639c467f3e6652a9875c27","permalink":"https://reinerng.github.io/publication/interactive-influence/","publishdate":"2020-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/interactive-influence/","section":"publication","summary":"Although past research showed that one’s initial attitudes can affect persuasion, few studies have explored this relationship by examining beliefs and emotions separately. Moreover, many health behavior campaigns show poor outcomes. For example, only 13.6% of young adults eat enough fruits and vegetables. This study explores how individuals’ initial attitudes interact with either a belief-focused or an emotion-focused message to affect fruits and vegetables consumption, which was found to be a cognitive meta-basis topic in pilot testing. That is, cultural norms for this topic creates more interests to process beliefs than emotions. In this study, individuals first reported their initial fruits and vegetables consumption attitudes. They were then randomly assigned to focus on either positive beliefs or emotions about eating fruits and vegetables, before reporting their consumption intentions. For those with less positive initial attitudes, focusing on emotions than on beliefs led to greater consumption intentions. But affective-cognitive focus did not matter for those with better initial attitudes. Thus, for those with less positive initial attitudes, message tailoring may backfire.","tags":[],"title":"The interactive influence of individuals’ initial attitudes and affective-cognitive persuasion on fruits and vegetables consumption","type":"publication"}]
